Problem statement: Create a blogging platform which has posts and comments.
Problem Details:

    Following entities are present in the system: Post, Part, Comment
    Post is composed of one title and many parts.
    Post has minimum 1 part. There is no limit for the maximum number of parts a post can have.
    Post has many comments
    Comment has an author name and a body
    Creating / editing posts:
        A standard Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete interface for Posts
        On the create & edit screens, there should be an ability to add / remove parts of that post.
    Viewing posts:
        On the index page, a paginated list of posts is shown. Each post id linked to its own show page.
        Each post has a show page
        The 1st part of the page is shown on the show page
        Links to subsequent parts of the post are provided at the bottom of the page. For. on part 1: 2, 3 & 4 are linked. On part 2: 1, 3 & 4 are linked.
        All comments that belong to that Post are shown on all the parts of the post.
    Creating and deleting comments:
        Comments can be created and deleted right from the view page of the post.

Additional Features for bonus points:

    Use 'ajax' to load the parts of a page
    Paginate comments and load them using ajax
    Make a beautiful looking system, by making use of a css framework, like Twitter Bootstrap.
    Instead of the default table layout that comes inbuilt with scaffold, use a Wordpress or Tumbler like layout.
    Use git to develop the code
